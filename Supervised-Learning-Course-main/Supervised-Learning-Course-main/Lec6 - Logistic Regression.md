# Logistic Regression
## Odd ratio

**Goal:** Change continuous value from z=(-inf, inf) to [0,1]

$Odd ratio = p/(1-p)$
This changes 0-1 values to 0-inf ... which is opposite of what we want.

Log Function:
changes 0->inf to -inf->inf


Things to ask:
- Doesnt convex depend on the 2 points we picked?
- Entropy vs Gini impurity






*Note: Search when not to use cross-validation*
